# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not file a public GitHub issue for security bugs.**

Please report security issues privately via [GitHub's Private Vulnerability
Reporting](../../security/advisories/new). The maintainer will acknowledge
within a reasonable timeframe and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

Examples of issues in scope:

- Parser bugs in template / `.docx` loading that lead to arbitrary code
  execution, prototype pollution, or path traversal when reading user-supplied
  files.
- XML-related vulnerabilities (XXE, billion-laughs, entity expansion) when
  parsing untrusted `.docx` packages.
- Zip-slip / archive-extraction issues in the OPC (OOXML packaging) layer.
- Output-side injection: generated XML/OOXML that escapes its escaping when
  given attacker-controlled text or attributes.
- Vulnerabilities in this project's bundled / vendored dependencies.
- Supply-chain issues with anything we publish on npm.

Out of scope by default:

- Pure denial-of-service from arbitrarily large input (callers are expected
  to bound input themselves).
- Concerns about the project's license itself.
- Issues that already have a public CVE upstream and where this project is
  only transitively affected — please report those upstream first; we will
  bump our pin once they release a fix.

## Supported versions

We patch the most recent minor release line. Pre-1.0, this is the latest
`0.Y.x` release. After 1.0, the latest `X.Y.x` of the current major.

<!-- TEMPLATE: replace this section with the project's actual support
     matrix once it has multiple supported branches. -->
